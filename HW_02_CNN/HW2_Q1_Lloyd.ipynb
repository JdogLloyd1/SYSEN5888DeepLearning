        "Bonus (+1): A skip connection in a neural network is a connection that skips one or more layers and connects to a later layer. Residual Networks (ResNets) have popularized the use of skip connections to address the vanishing gradient problem, and hence enabling the training of deeper networks. Your task for this bonus part is to integrate such a skip connection, any types of skip connections are acceptable. For instance, linking the output of the first layer convolutional directly to the input of the last convolutional layer in your model architecture. Based on your results, analyze and discuss any improvements or effects this change has on the model's performance"
