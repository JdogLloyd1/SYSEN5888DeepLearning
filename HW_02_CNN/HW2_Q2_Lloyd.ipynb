        "Task: Load the IMDB dataset from Keras using a vocabulary size of 2000 for tokenization & numericalization. Each review in the dataset is already pre-processed and encoded as a sequence of word indexes. A mapping between words and their corresponding indexes is provided using the `imdb.get_word_index()` method. For consistent input to the model, your task is to pad the reviews or truncate them to a uniform length. This can be achieved using the `pad_sequences` method from Keras to convert all reviews to a length of 300 words using the `maxlen` argument in the `pad_sequences` method. The preprocessed NumPy arrays will then be fed into a PyTorch CNN for sentiment classification."

A subset of the training data (1000 samples) should be set aside as a validation set, while the rest should be used for training. The model should be trained for a total of 30 (or 10) epochs, with a batch size of 32. After training, the model should be evaluated on the test data to obtain the final accuracy score. This will give a measure of how well the model can generalize to unseen reviews."
