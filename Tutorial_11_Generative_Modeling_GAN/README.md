# Generative Modeling with GANs

This repository offers two comprehensive tutorials on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) implemented using TensorFlow and PyTorch. Both tutorials guide you through building, training, and evaluating GANs for various generative modeling tasks.

## Tutorials Overview

### 1. TensorFlow GAN Tutorial
- **File**: `Tutorial#11 (tf) Generative Modeling GAN.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook covers the implementation of GANs using TensorFlow. It introduces key concepts, the architectural design of GANs, and effective training strategies.
- **Requirements**:
  - Python 3.7 or higher
  - TensorFlow 2.x
  - NumPy, Matplotlib

### 2. PyTorch GAN Tutorial
- **File**: `Tutorial#11 (torch) Generative Modeling GAN.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook provides a detailed implementation of GANs using PyTorch. It demonstrates similar GAN concepts as the TensorFlow version but leverages PyTorch’s dynamic computation graph and custom training loops.
- **Special Note**: The dataset used in the PyTorch tutorial is based on material electron microscopy data, providing real-world images that are ideal for training and evaluating generative models.
- **Requirements**:
  - Python 3.7 or higher
  - PyTorch 1.x or later
  - NumPy, Matplotlib

## Features
- **Step-by-step explanations**: Clear comments and detailed guidance are provided throughout the notebooks.
- **Hands-on practice**: Experiment with your own GAN implementations and explore custom modifications.
- **Framework comparison**: Understand how GANs can be implemented differently in TensorFlow and PyTorch.
