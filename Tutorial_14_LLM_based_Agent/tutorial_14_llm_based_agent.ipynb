    "# LLM-Based Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM-based agents leverage the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, such as GPT, to perform complex tasks by understanding and generating human-like text. These agents are increasingly used in applications like virtual assistants, content generation, customer support, and decision-making systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an LLM-Based Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "An LLM-based agent is a software system that integrates a pretrained language model with additional components to perform specific tasks autonomously. These agents process natural language inputs, generate meaningful responses, and often interact with external systems to execute actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "1. **LLM Core**: The pretrained large language model that understands and generates text.  \n",
    "2. **Task-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Adapts the LLM to a particular domain or task using specialized datasets.  \n",
    "3. **Tool Integration**: Connects the agent with external tools (e.g., APIs, databases) to enhance functionality.  \n",
    "4. **Memory and Context Handling**: Allows the agent to maintain context across interactions, enabling coherent multi-turn conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How LLM-Based Agents Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Processing**: The agent receives natural language input from the user.  \n",
    "2. **Model Inference**: The LLM generates a response or determines the next action based on the input.  \n",
    "3. **Action Execution**: If required, the agent performs an action, such as querying a database or invoking an API.  \n",
    "4. **Output Generation**: The agent delivers a response to the user, completing the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training and Adaptation:\n",
    "- **Pretraining**: The base LLM is trained on a massive corpus of text, learning patterns, grammar, and general knowledge.  \n",
    "- **Fine-Tuning**: Task-specific fine-tuning helps the agent specialize in areas like medical consultation, coding assistance, or creative writing.  \n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Ensures the responses align with human expectations, improving quality and safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of LLM-Based Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Virtual Assistants**: Personalized support for scheduling, reminders, and general queries.  \n",
    "2. **Customer Service**: Handling inquiries, resolving issues, and automating responses.  \n",
    "3. **Content Creation**: Generating articles, summaries, or creative works like stories and poetry.  \n",
    "4. **Decision Support**: Assisting professionals in fields like law, healthcare, and finance by providing insights and recommendations.  \n",
    "5. **Coding Assistance**: Aiding developers by generating code snippets, debugging, or answering programming-related questions."

    "- Visit the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/).\n",
    "- If you don’t have an account, click **Sign Up** to create one.\n",
    "- If you already have an account, click **Log In** to access your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Go to the API Keys Page\n",
    "- After logging in, click on your profile icon in the top-right corner.\n",
    "- Select **\"View API Keys\"** from the dropdown menu or go directly to the [API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Generate a New Key\n",
    "- On the API Keys page, click the **\"Create new secret key\"** button.\n",
    "- A new API key will be generated and displayed on the screen. **Copy this key immediately** and save it securely (it will only be shown once).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Important Notes\n",
    "- Treat your API key as a secret and do not share it publicly.\n",
    "- Avoid hardcoding the key directly in your code. Instead, use environment variables or a secret management tool.\n",
    "- Ensure your account has **Billing** enabled to access paid services.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Using the Key\n",
    "Once you have your API key, you can use it in your projects to access OpenAI's features, such as GPT models, image generation, or other services.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m find the net profit from Burt's basil plants.

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m find the net profit from Burt's basil plants. We first need to find the total cost of the seeds and soil, which is $2.00 + $8.00 = $10.00. Next, we need to find the total revenue from selling the basil plants, which is 20 plants x $5.00 per plant = $100.00. Finally, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. This gives us $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.\n",
